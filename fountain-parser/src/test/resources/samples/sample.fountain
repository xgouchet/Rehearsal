INT. A HOUSE - DAY

We hear a radio playing music, Queen's _“Bohemian Rhapsody”_.

~Mama, just killed a man
~Put a gun against his head
~Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
~Mama, life had just begun
~But now I've gone and thrown it all away

DAVID
(Singing along)
~Mama, ooo
~Didn't mean to make you cry
~If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
~Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
This song is stupid !
(Turns the radio off)
