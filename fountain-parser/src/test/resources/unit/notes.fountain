INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

This is the home of THE BOY BAND, AKA DAN and JACK[[Or did we think of actual names for these guys?]].  They too are drinking beer, and counting the take from their last smash-and-grab.  Money, drugs, and ridiculous props are strewn about the table.

[[It was supposed to be Vietnamese, right?]]

JACK
(in Vietnamese, subtitled)
*Did you know Brick and Steel are retired?*

His hand is an inch from the receiver when the phone RINGS.  Scott pauses for a moment, suspicious for some reason.[[This section needs work.
Either that, or I need coffee.

Definitely coffee.]] He looks around.  Phone ringing.
